# The assembly effect: the connectedness between populations is a double-edged sword for public health interventions
This is a currated repository for a mathematical modeling exercise on paper mentioned in the title. R language was used for all the experiements herein. The model adapted was previously published [here](https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-017-2130-3).

## How to run the scripts
The main modeling experiment is in the first file "1_MDA_eff_homo_cov_forloop_seas.R". The file will generate a series of model output written in their specific folders which are not included here. Working directory will have to be adapted to reproduce it. Most of the remaining files read in the model output to create graphs.
